<p class=MsoTitle><b><u><span lang=EN-US>Production Possibility Frontiers</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Production possibility
frontiers (PPFs) depict the maximum productive potential of an economy, using a
combination of two goods or services, when resources are fully and efficiently
employed.<br>
PPF curves can show the opportunity cost of using the scarce resources. For
example, if the scare resource is milk, there is a trade-off between producing
more cheese or more yoghurt from the milk. The PPF can show this: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=310 height=237 id="Picture 4"
src="t1.4.fld/image001.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Producing at points A and B
are the most efficient combinations of output on the PPF. Producing at B, so
more yoghurt than cheese is produced, incurs an opportunity cost of producing
more cheese.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>The law of diminishing
returns </span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>states that the
opportunity cost of producing more yoghurt increases, in terms of the lost
units of cheese that could have been produced.<br>
Producing at C or D is inefficient, and resources are not used to their </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>full productive potential. </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is the potential to use these
resources more efficiently, which would shift production closer to the curve.<br>
Producing at E is not yet attainable with the current resources </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=319 height=236 id="Picture 5"
src="t1.4.fld/image002.png"></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This PPF shows the
opportunity cost of producing each product. Producing 100 units of cheese means
that only 40 units of yoghurt can be produced instead of the potential of 90.
Therefore, the opportunity cost is 90 - 40 = 50 units of yoghurt. </span></p>

<h1>Economic growth and decline: </h1>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The PPF can also depict
economic growth or decline. Only production under and on the PPF is attainable.
Production outside of the PPF is not obtainable. However, only production on
the PPF uses resources efficiently (A and B). It is inefficient to produce below
the PPF (point C). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=328 height=234 id="Picture 6"
src="t1.4.fld/image003.png"></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Economic growth can be shown
by an outward shift in the PPF, from the curve with point A on it, to the curve
with point B on it. A decline in the economy would be depicted by an inward
shift.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'><br>
The original curve is drawn assuming: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A fixed amount of resources are used </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is a constant state of
technology<br>
An increase in the quantity or quality of resources shifts the PPF curve
outwards, so the productive potential of the economy increases, and there is
economic growth. This can be achieved with the use of supply side policies. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Moving along the PPF is
different to shifting the PPF. Moving along the PPF uses the same number and
state of resources, and shifts production from fewer consumer goods to more
capital goods, for instance. This incurs an opportunity cost. Shifting the PPF
curve outwards, for example, uses either more resources or resources of a
greater quality. This reduces the opportunity cost of producing either capital
or consumer goods, since more goods can be produced overall. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Capital goods </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>are goods which can be used to produce
other goods, such as machinery.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Consumer goods </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>are goods which cannot be used to
produce other goods, such as clothing. </span></p>
