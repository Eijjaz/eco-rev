<p class=MsoTitle><u><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Rational
decision making</span></u></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This is an area of
behavioural economics.<br>
When making economic decisions, consumers aim to maximise their utility and
firms aim to maximise profits.<br>
A consumer’s utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a good
or service.<br>
Daniel Kahneman is a Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences, which he won for
his work on behavioural economics. He devised a two-system model which explains
how decisions are made. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The first system is based on common
sense estimates and emotional responses to the choice made. It uses short cuts
and quick decisions are made. This is the dominant system, but the bias and
potential for error in the system can mean irrational decisions could be made. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The second system takes longer than
the first. It uses thoughts and reflections, and avoids the bias and errors from
the first system. However, because of how easily the system is manipulated, the
decisions made could be harmful to the consumer or others around them. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A firm or an individual can make
decisions using intuition or rationally. Intuition uses the feelings or
instincts of the consumer and does not use facts. Businesses use this when they
do not have access to facts or when making the decision is difficult. A
rational decision is made using several steps, and it involves analysis and
facts. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Identify the problem: For a firm, this
might be falling profits. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Find and identify the decision
criteria: The firm might have to find information or criteria that will
increase their profits. The firm’s criteria might include, for example, keep a
certain number of employees or to not change the price of their goods. The
criteria might include how the decision will affect stakeholders (the customer
and the staff, for instance), and how the quality might be affected. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Weigh the criteria: The firm will have
to rank the criteria based on their relative importance. They might think
keeping all of their employees is the most important, for example. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Generate alternatives: The firm might
consider some alternative options. For instance, they might think that moving
their premises somewhere else will reduce costs and hence increase profits.
Perhaps they will consider a loyalty scheme or a promotion for the consumer.
Alternatively, the might decide to reduce the size of their workforce. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Evaluate alternative options: The firm
might now consider which of the alternatives meet their criteria the best, and
help them increase their profits the most. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Choose the best alternative: Now the
firm will choose the alternative they think meets their criteria. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Carry out the decision: The firm can
now see what the consequences of the decision are. </span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Evaluate the decision: After seeing
what effect the decision has on the firm, they can consider whether this was
the best option or not. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Limitations: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This is not always the best
or most realistic way for firms to make decisions. Although it might be fairer
than making an intuitive decision, it takes significantly longer to decide,
which is not practical in a firm with strict time constraints. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The Administrative Man: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Herbert Simon recognised
these limitations, so he devised the bounded rationality model, which is also
known as the administrative man theory.<br>
The assumptions of this model are: </span></p>

style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The first alternative that is
satisfactory is selected</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span

to be comfortable making decisions without considering every alternative </span><span

style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Decisions could be made by heuristics.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Heuristics simplify the decision-making
process to come to a reasonable decision. They are shortcuts to avoid taking
too long to make the decision, and they avoid the problem of having imperfect
information or limited time.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>For example, the consumer might use
common sense or intuition. They might consider how it is cheaper to buy goods
in the sale. They might have pre-decided criteria, or a rule-of-thumb, and only
buy the good if it is in a sale. This could lead to irrational decisions being
made. </span></p>
