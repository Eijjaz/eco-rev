<p class=MsoTitle><b><u><span lang=EN-US>Specialisation and division of labour</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Specialisation occurs when
each worker is completes a specific task in a production process. The concept
was famously stated by Adam Smith, who showed how, through the division of
labour, worker productivity can increase. Firms can then take advantage of
increased efficiency and lower average costs of production. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>An extract from </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Italic",serif'>The Wealth of Nations, </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Adam Smith: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;color:#333333'>“To
take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which
the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the
pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business ... could scarce, perhaps,
with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make
twenty. But in the way, in which this business is now carried on, not only the
whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of
which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the
wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds
it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three
distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins
is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the
important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about
eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed
by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or
three of them... But though they were very poor, and therefore but
indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they
exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There
are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten
persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins
in a day.” </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Smith essentially said that
by dividing the production of pins into 18 different tasks, the output of pins
could increase significantly. Each worker specialises and output increases. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Specialisation can be
achieved by individuals, businesses, regions of countries or countries
themselves. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Advantages: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Higher output and potentially higher
quality, since production focusses on what people and businesses are best at. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There could be a greater variety of
goods and services produced.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There are more opportunities for
economies of scale, so the size of the </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>market increases.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is more competition and this
gives an incentive for firms to lower their </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>costs, which helps to keep
prices down. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Disadvantages: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Work becomes repetitive,
which could lower the motivation of workers, potentially affecting quality and
productivity. Workers could become dissatisfied. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There could be more structural
unemployment, since skills might not be transferable, especially because
workers have focussed on one task for so long. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>By producing a lot of one type of good
through specialisation, variety could in fact decrease for consumers. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There could be higher worker turnover
for firms, which means employees become dissatisfied with their jobs and leave
regularly. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Specialisation in the
production of goods and services to trade: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Countries can specialise in
the production of certain goods. For example, Norway is one of the world’s
largest oil exporters. Countries trade to get the goods and services they are
unable to produce. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Countries can exploit their </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>comparative advantage </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>in a good, which means they can
produce a good at a lower opportunity cost to another. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Absolute advantage </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>occurs when a country can produce more
of a good with the same factor inputs. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Advantages: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Greater world output, so there is a
gain in economic welfare.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Lower average costs, since the market
becomes more competitive. </span><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o
</span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is an increased
supply of goods to choose from.<br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>There is an outward shift in the PPF
curve. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>Disadvantages: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Less developed countries might use up
their non-renewable resources too quickly, so they might run out. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Countries could become over-dependent
on the export of one commodity, such as wheat. If there are poor weather
conditions, or the price falls, then the economy would suffer. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>The
functions of money: </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>A medium of exchange: </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>without money, transactions were
conducted through bartering. Goods and services were traded with other goods
and services, but people did not always get exactly what they wanted or needed.
The goods and services exchanged were not always of the same value, which also
posed a problem. Exchange could only take place if there was a </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>double coincidence of wants, </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>i.e. both parties have to want the
good the other party offer. Using money eliminates this problem. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>A measure of value (unit of account): </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Money provides a means to measure the
relative values of different goods and services. For example, a piece of
jewellery might be considered more valuable than a table because of the
relative price, measured by money. Money also puts a value on labour. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>A store of value: </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Money has to hold its value to be used
for payment. It can be kept for a long time without expiring. However, the
quantity of goods and services that can be bought with money fluctuates
slightly with the forces of supply and demand. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Courier New",serif'>o </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri,Bold",serif'>A method of deferred payment: </span><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Money can allow for debts to be
created. People can therefore pay for things without having money in the
present, and can pay for it later. This relies on money storing its value </span></p>
